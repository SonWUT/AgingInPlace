    "description": "Our bones are constantly renewed through a natural process in which new bone cells replace old bone cells. As we age, however, this process becomes less efficient and we begin to gradually lose bone tissue.\n\nOsteoporosis is a bone disease where bone loss occurs more rapidly than normal causing bones to become very thin and weak over time. While osteoporosis is more common among older individuals, it can affect people of all ages. \n\nSeveral factors play a role in the development of osteoporosis and the more risk factors you have, the greater your risk. Since bone loss occurs without symptoms, determining  you have osteoporosis requires a bone mineral density test. Your doctor may want you to have a bone mineral density test  you have the following risk factors:\n\n>Being 65 years or older\n>Fragility fracture (breaking a bone as a result of a minor accident)\n>Long term use of glucocorticoids such as prednisone\n>Having a parent who had a hip fracture\n>Having a spine fracture or low bone mass identied on x-ray\n>Being a smoker\n>High alcohol intake (greater than or equal to 3 units per day on a consistent basis)\n>Low body weight (less than 60 kg or 132 lbs) or major weight loss (present weight is more than 10% below your weight at age 25)\n>Having other disorders strongly associated with rapid bone loss and/or fracture as mentioned above.",
